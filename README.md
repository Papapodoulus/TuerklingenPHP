# timbrePHP
<p>A simple doorbell made with PHP, Javascript and JQuery.</p>
<p>I have based it on an example in which there is a building with offices, with X floors, on each floor there are X rooms, and those X rooms can have X devices, each room can belong to a different company. The size of the doorbell buttons depends on the number of rooms the company has.</p>
